# Introduction
For each in-person meeting, the IETF says on its website that it grants onsite fee waiver requests. This document outlines guidelines to support those responsible for granting onsite fee waiver requests being able to do so. 


## Purpose

The IETF has received legitimate criticism regarding the lack of representation from the global south, civil society groups,  people under 30, people who’s first language is not english, along with low numbers of women participants. An onsite fee waiver program is one way to support people who would not otherwise be able to attend in person being able to do so and making vital in person human to human connections that can enhance the quality of their contributions, feeling of belonging and ability to contribute to making the internet better via participation in the IETF. 

Asking for a fee waiver is an act of vulnerability on the part of the requestor. They must petition an entity, the IETF, and people in positions of power within the organization that have much more power then they do. It is important to assume good intent on both sides. It is also important to have the process feel dignified and fair. This document provides guidelines for this process including questions that a requestor could be asked. 


##  Definitions

**Requestor:** The person who is petitioning the IETF for an onsite fee waiver request.

**Grantee:** The person who made the request for a fee waiver and was granted it.

**Grantor:** The person or people who act on behalf of the IETF to review requestors applications and grant onsite fee waiver requests. 

**Full Fee Waiver:** This gives a person a waiver for the full registration fee

**Partial Fee Waiver:** This gives a waiver to a person for part of the registration fee


# Background

At the time of writing the first draft, the Onsite Participation Fee Waiver process puts requests for fee waivers burden entirely at the discretion of the IETF chair. There is no clear guidance for the chair to make decisions about fee waiver requests, what questions to ask or how to think about what the goals of the IETF are by having a fee waiver request. 

The goal is to improve the current process. Currently, the remote participation fee request process is initiated via filling out a very simple form. The process for requesting an onsite fee waiver request is initiated via writing an e-mail support@ietf.org along with a request to “please include information to explain why you require an onsite fee waiver.” 

This draft assumes that the current process stays the same and that one person or potentially a small group interacts directly in e-mail with a requestor. In the future a simple application form could provide inputs into this process with questions derived from this list. 


# Acceptable Questions for Fee Waiver Requests

This section outlines acceptable questions for a grantor to ask the requestor. 


## Identifying Need
These questions help get at the motivation of the requestor for making the request and helps the grantor understand their motivations along with how they believe they can bring value to the IETF. 

- Why do you want to attend this meeting?
   - What do you hope to get out of attending?
   - What do you hope to contribute to the meeting?

- How have you been engaged in the IETF?

- Where do you currently work? 

- Have you attended the IETF before? 
   - How many times? 
   - In-Person or Virtually

- Where in the world are you based? 
   - Is English your first language?

## Means Testing

This outlines considerations for “means testing” and what questions can be asked to assess the financial need of the petitioner.

- How are you funding your participation in the IETF?
   - Are you self funded? 

- What is your total budget for attending the meeting?
   - How critical is it a fee waiver to making attendance possible? 

## Documentation Requests
Some documentation may be helpful in making a decision about granting a fee waiver. 
- A letter from a chair of one of the working groups that the requestor is actively participating in. 
- Documentation of the cost of travel from one destination to another (This can help people from remote locations demonstrate how much they must spend on travel and why a fee waiver for onsite participation makes the difference in being able to attend). 
- Documentation of independent work
- Documentation about the person’s belonging to an under represented group


# Decision-Making Process:

## Who makes the decision

The current process routes all requests through the chair. 

An alternative process that reduces burdens on the chair being the decider of who can attend. This could be a small group composed of 2-3 members of IETF leadership who can rotate through each meeting and make the decisions. 

It could be that one member of the IAB, one member of the IESG and one member of the staff per meeting are designated as the fee waiver handlers and there is a budget allocated per meeting for them to grant waivers. These guidelines can help those who are responsible for granting fee waiver requests for a particular meeting providing consistency across 


## How is the decision made

It is important to ensure that the review process is objective, impartial, and confidential.

The grantor(s) shall evaluate requests against the established eligibility criteria and consider the potential impact of the participant's presence at the event. 

Those requisition fee waivers need to know as soon as possible if their request has been granted so they can book travel and accommodations that are low cost. 

Once registration opens for a meeting the grantors will meet on a rolling basis to grant onsite participation fee waivers based on the answers received. When the budget for fee waivers has been used then no more fee waivers will be granted for that meeting. 


## How is the decision communicated?
The Grantor(s) will clearly communicate to the requestor in a timely manner if their fee waiver request has been granted. 

# Budget for Fee Waivers

For each IETF meeting a budget there shall be a dollar amount set aside to provide onsite fee waiver requests. 

Sponsorships for fee waivers request fulfillment could be a part of IETF meeting support. 

In order to support more people attending there should be fee waivers partial fee waivers shall also be granted. 

# Duties of the Grantee

Fee waivers are an exchange of value. The IETF provides fee waivers to grantees and in return the grantee will be contributing back to the IETF working groups. One way to support this value exchange being seen and acknowledged is to ask the grantee to share key learnings and takeaways from their participation. Within a week of the meeting all grantees will share these with a staff person and a summary of these will be shared on the IETF blog.  

The grantees may be requested to post about IETF in their social media. IETF shall provide the corresponding #Tags.


# Reporting out to the Plenary about fee waiver Requests

The number of fee waiver requests shall be disclosed to the plenary along with how many were granted along with the following information. 
The total budget for fee waivers for this particular meeting
A breakdown at the continent level of where the requestors and grantees are from
A breakdown of how many women where requestors and grantees
A breakdown of the age ranges that requestors and grantees were from (under 30) (30-40) (40-50) 50+
